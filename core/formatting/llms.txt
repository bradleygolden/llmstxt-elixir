# Elixir Formatting Guidelines

> Use `mix format` to automatically format Elixir code. This ensures consistency across the codebase.

> Keep lines reasonably short, ideally under 100 characters, to enhance readability. `mix format` helps enforce this with its `line_length` option.

> Use whitespace consistently to separate logical blocks of code, but avoid excessive blank lines.
