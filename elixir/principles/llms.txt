# Elixir Programming Principles

> Prefer readability and clarity in code. Avoid overly complex or "clever" solutions that obscure intent.

> Prefer immutability. Leverage Elixir's immutable data structures and avoid side effects where possible.

> Avoid boolean obsession. Do not overuse boolean flags as function arguments or struct fields; consider using more descriptive types (atoms, structs) or pattern matching instead.
