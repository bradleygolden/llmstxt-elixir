# Elixir Process Anti-patterns

> Avoid organizing code solely by process type (e.g., all GenServers in one module). Group by domain or feature instead.

> Avoid scattered process interfaces. Define a clear API module for interacting with processes.

> Avoid sending unnecessary data between processes. Send only the required information.

> Avoid unsupervised processes. Ensure processes are properly supervised within a supervision tree.
